# Vibe Check

Vibe Check is a new dating app feature that helps online daters form a more meaningful connection with their matches through a fun quiz format. 
By answering questions related to dating preferences, values, goals, and life experiences, they get a dater type result and report that can be viewed by their matches. 
This extra information can help spark better conversations, which lead to more first dates.
